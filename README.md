# StickFigureWalkingAI
A WIP project to teach a stick figure how to walk using Unity, C#, and Neural Networks

#### Disclaimer
*This is an imcomplete project that is continuously being worked on and improved. There are most likely many issues with the code, but with time, I plan to make this program better!*

## About
This project is my first attempt at creating, implementing, and training a Neural Network. I wanted to learn how to make a complex figure learn how to perform a task, rather than give a cube some sensors and tell it to not crash. This project has been created with the help of Unity, C#, and quite a few online resources.

## Usage
Anyone is free to download and experiment with this code, and I encourage you to improve it! I would also love to hear of any improvements you make to it, because this is a fun project to work on, and exciting to learn more about.

## Installation
**Please make sure you have Unity and a C# IDE in order to view, use, and modify the program**

After downloading the .zip file, import the folder containing all assests into Unity. In Assets, open up the "Scenes" folder to locate "FlatScene." You may now run the program inside Unity.
